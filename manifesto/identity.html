        <h1>ON IDENTITY OF OBJECTS</h1>
        <h1>☀</h1>
        <p>The identity of objects is often called into question. Common pop-philosophy variants of 
            the problem of identity include: is a hotdog a sandwich? Is cereal a soup? What is 
            considered a chair?</p>
        <p>Humans, who are so eager to classify and categorize objects into clear and distinct groups, 
            are disappointed by the lack of specificity definitions such as sandwich and soup entail. 
            OCCULT aims to shed SUN on the nature of identification, and what is indeed, something.</p>
        <p>Consider the third and final question posed above: what is a chair? Imagine a generic, four 
            legged object, that is (nearly ) universally agreed upon to be a chair, as depicted below in 
            Figure 1. If one of the legs was to be removed (Figure 2), would it still be a chair? Most 
            would answer yes. If the backing of the chair was removed (Figure 3), would the chair still 
            be a chair? It almost appears to be a table. Is the object in Figure 4 a chair? How about 
            Figure 5? At which point does the chair stop being a chair?</p>

        <p>OCCULT wants to draw attention to the similarities between the problem of identity and the 
            sorites paradox. Imagine that you have a heap of sand on your palm, and that each grain is 
            removed individually from that heap. There is no point in the removal process where you can 
            say that the heap has suddenly stopped being a heap. The heap-ness factor of the pile instead 
            changes the more you take away from it. The same applies to the problem of identity. A 
            sandwich can be more or less a sandwich, but there is no defined line between what is or is 
            not a sandwich.</p>
        <p>We now present the OCCULTIAN GRADIENT OF IDENTITY.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Imagine that a spotlight shines down in the middle of a room, and illuminates the centre. 
            The collection of items that most would clearly and undeniably perceive as the “object” 
            reside in the centre of the circle. As the light diffuses from the circle, the boundary 
            between what is and what isn’t is much less clear. This is where the ambiguous objects lie, 
            such as the hotdog in the definition gradient of “sandwich”. There is no defined line where 
            the light stops and the darkness starts, there is just a diffusion of light. It is still 
            clear however that there is an area of the diagram that is illuminated by the light, and an 
            area that isn’t.<sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>WHAT DEFINES A LIGHT: Firstly, OCCULT agrees that identity exists as a social reality<sup>2</sup>, 
            and is thus defined not objectively but relative to the group that perceives it. The light 
            is loosely defined by a cluster of properties associated with the object. The properties 
            that constitute a sandwich, for example, may consist of: being made of two items with one 
            or more items in between, edibility, presentation, and so on. A generic PB&J sandwich hits 
            all of the required elements, so it falls in the blue x of the diagram above. A hotdog is 
            missing crucial properties associated with a sandwich, but fits others–hence, discourse on 
            whether or not the light shines on it, and is represented by the green x of the diagram. A 
            chair is not a sandwich at all, so it is represented by the red x, in an area that no light 
            shines on at all.</p>

        <h3 id="pi">ON PERSONAL IDENTITY</h3>
	    <p>OCCULT considers the matter of personal identity in line with its GRADIENT OF IDENTITY. 
            We will establish all the properties that contribute to the definition of personal identity 
            have below:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Person x, at time t<sub>1</sub> is to varying degrees the same person y, at time t<sub>2</sub> depending on 
            how many of the following points are fulfilled, and to what degrees they are fulfilled.</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person x shares spacio-temporal continuity with person y.</li>
            <li>Person x and person y have the same memory.</li>
            <ul class="sublist">
                <li>Person x and person y are memory-connected (memory between t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> is continuous).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Person x and person y have the same brain.</li>
            <ul class="sublist">
                <li>There is psychological continuity between person x and person y.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Person x and person y have the same consciousness.</li>
            <ul class="sublist">
                <li>There is a continuity between the consciousnesses of person x and person y.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Person x has the same body as person y.</li>
            <ul class="sublist">
                <li>There is physical continuity between person x and person y.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>This list is mutable and likely incomplete. OCCULT welcomes public suggestions to further the
            comprehensiveness of these properties listed.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><sup>1</sup>This serves as a refutation to nihilistic theories of identity. One cannot say 
            that there is no “real” identity just because one cannot discern where it stops and where it 
            starts.</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup>All definitions are social and can never be universal.</p>
