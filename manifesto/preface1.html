            <h1>PREFACE: THE PROBLEM OF NIHILISM</h1>
            <h1>☀</h1>
	        <p>OCCULT recognizes the problem of nihilism in regards to establishing proper metaphysical 
                theories. We generally agree with the principle that most things can be reduced to 
                nothing. However, it is easy and not very useful to prove that everything is nothing, 
                and much more difficult but much more practical to attempt to generate something from 
                nothing. Thus, as we go through the list of metaphysical topics in the rest of the 
                manifesto (read: the other chapters of this series), we will acknowledge each topic’s 
                “nothingness” here, and also describe the scope which we are looking at the problem 
                through.

                <li>Identity of objects - true numerical identity, i.e. object x is equal to object y can 
                    only exist instantaneously. OCCULT rejects true numerical identity as the concept of 
                    identity however, because clearly there exists a social identity that is not strictly 
                    numerical, and this is what we aim to determine. We believe that definitions exist on 
                    primarily social axioms, and will treat identity as such.</li>
