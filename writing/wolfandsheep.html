<p>Wolf is chasing Sheep around the field, claws outstretched, drool hanging from his jaws.</p>
<p>Sheep is running away as usual, when he suddenly stops, and turns towards the sky as if seeing for the first time. A break in character.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: It's really pretty outside today.</p>
<p>Wolf pauses his running, to look up. Sucks his drool back in thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: Yeah, I guess it is.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: Look at all that sun. And construction. And sky. And construction.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: It's so nice today, I won't even try to eat you like usual.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: That's quite kind of you.</p>
<p>Sheep pauses.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: Do you ever wonder... if we're going to run out of things to write here?</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: What do you mean? We? What's writing?</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: \*Sighs.\* You wouldn't get it. It's okay though. Just a break from the routine is nice.</p>
<p>They sit back together against a tree. Sheep puts his hooves behind his head and closes his eyes. A moment of quiet.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: Routine?</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: You know, every day we get up and run around and you try to eat me and my friends. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, and then we do it again the next day.</p>
<p>Beat.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: Don't you ever wonder why? It's like we're doing these same thing every day, but for what?</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: For survival?</p>
<p>Another beat.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: I guess. But wouldn't you like a break in the routine? What if we had a tea party in the woods? Or went on a grand
adventure together? Don't our lives seem so repetitive sometimes? What if we actually did something?</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: Do you ever stop consider--there's nothing about our lives that actually make them worth living.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: ...you lost me.</p>
<p class="indent">SHEEP: I had a dream the other day that I was some human sitting at a computer, writing. That was kinda nice.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: Hey Sheep?</p>
<p>Wolf pauses. Licks around his snout.</p>
<p class="indent">WOLF: I'm hungry.</p>
<p>Sheep gets up, bleats, then runs away. Wolf chases after him. Ad infinitum.</p>
