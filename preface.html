            <h1>PREFACE: FOR THE SKEPTICAL READER</h1>
            <h1>☀</h1>
	        <p>OCCULT will not waste too much time trying to convince the outside reader right now to follow its 
                practices. As a group focused on truth-seeking, our aim is not to convince you that our practices 
                are gospel, or end-all-be-all (although of course, we certainly think so). We are an amateur group 
                with no true qualifications or expertise on anything at all. However, there are some compelling 
                reasons for why our words, among millions, are issued with some merit. The reasons are provided 
                below:</p>
            <h3>THE FOLLOWING ARE PROMISES OCCULT UPHOLDS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We vow that what is said in the manifesto, to the best of our ability, is honestly and 
                    sincerely what we believe at all times.</li>
                <li>We vow to never manipulate or deceive the audience for our own benefit.</li>
                <li>We vow to be open-minded and unprejudiced.</li>
                <li>We vow to be rational.</li>
                <li>We vow to be as unswayed as possible by personal biases.</li>
            </ol>

	        <p>It is most likely that you reading this right now are in Stage II (see SUN:1), and also quite 
                content with your position in this stage. Perhaps you believe that even if your life is 
                inauthentic, you do not need to improve it, and are skeptical of the idea that you would need to 
                “ascend” at all. OCCULT does not disagree. The average human life is lived unauthentically, and 
                there is nothing wrong with choosing this path. We will not attempt to sway you from this 
                position.</p>
        	<p>However, for those who want something more— maybe you feel a stagnation in your life, that it’s 
                hit some sort of dead end, or that you’re unhappy day to day, or that you feel something is 
                missing, or maybe you’re simply curious. OCCULT is duty-bound to do its best to provide you as 
                rich and succinct of a Sun Truth as it possibly can. Read on.</p>
