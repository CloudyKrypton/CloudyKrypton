              <p>If you’re reading this, you probably know me as CloudyKrypton from discord. I’m a computer science and philosophy major. I’m not quite sure what I want to do with this website yet; maybe it’s a place to dump all the projects that I’ll be working on. To be decided.

              <p>Well, what kind of stuff do you want to know about me?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>My favourite philosophers are <span class="tt">Spinoza<span class="ttt">test</span></span> and de Beauvoir.</li>
                <li>The best movies I watched last year were <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> and <i>The Wicker Man</i>. I like animated films, and films with messages and deep feels.
                  <a href="https://letterboxd.com/cloudykrypton/">Letterboxd</a></li>
                <li>My favourite books are <i>Station 11</i> by Emily St. John Mandel and <i>The Invisible Life of Addie Larue</i> by V. E. Schwab. I used to have a GoodReads account once upon a time…</li>
                <li>My favourite anime is <i>Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</i>. Anilist <a href="https://anilist.co/user/CloudyKrypton/" target="_blank">here</a>, although there isn’t much on it</li>
