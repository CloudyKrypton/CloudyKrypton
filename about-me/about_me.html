            <p>If you’re reading this, you probably know me as CloudyKrypton from discord. I’m a computer 
            science and philosophy major, going into my second year of university. Outside of school 
            I’m into a ton of random stuff—consuming all kinds of media, making all kinds of things. 
            This website is a little barren and unfinished for now, but over time I hope to populate 
            it with more content as I go deeper into HTML and JS this summer, so stay tuned.</p>
