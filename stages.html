        <p>The <i><u>Primitive Stage</i></u> of ascension encompasses those individuals who are extremely ignorant. 
            Ascension from this stage will typically naturally occur before age 15 for the average individual, with 
            no external effort required. Some advanced individuals even skip the primitive stage entirely, 
            being born into Stage II directly. However, if one fails to surpass this stage on their own, or 
            they regress from a later stage to the primitive stage, the fix (read: Sun Truth Series I) should 
            be very simple and short.</p>
        <p>Those who are lost in the Primitive Stage:</p>
        <p>Some in the Primitive Stage are afraid of ascending into Stage II, and deny themselves the true nature 
            of their current state. They are aware of the pitfalls of Stage II, but because of this they deny 
            themselves the opportunity to move forward. A typical application of this is to “negate” the sheep 
            mentality. As an example, mainstream music is labeled with sheep mentality (“basicness”), so Stage 
            II deniers will listen to only things that are not considered mainstream music, irrespective of the 
            actual quality of the music. However, what they neglect to realize when they do this is that they are 
            equally controlled by outsider opinion as those in Stage II, under the guise that they have free will, 
            when in actuality, they do not. The superiority of Stage II deniers is unearned.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Your intrinsic worth is <i>equal</i> to that of every single human being on this planet.</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>There is nothing that can affect a person’s intrinsic worth. One enlightened being is not 
                    worth more than an unenlightened being. One physically superior being is not worth more than 
                    a weaker being.</li>
                <li>Therefore, you are not intrinsically better (or worse) than anyone.</li>
                <li>Bonus: (for those lost in I) following sheep mentality does not make you worse than anyone, 
                    and it often leads to some happiness.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Your (Stage I Dweller) overaggressiveness and superior mindset is a product of insecurity.</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>A secure individual will not feel the need to feel intrinsically superior in comparison to 
                    others.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Most people are not as hostile minded as you (Stage I Dweller).</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Most of the world has at least ascended to Stage II.</li>
                <li>You needn’t be so defensive or aggressive.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p><i><u>Stage II</u></i> of ascension is marked with typical traits of adolescence: insecurity, the desire 
            to conform, and a denial of <i>true</i> authenticity.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons why one would be stuck in Stage II. In fact, a great portion of 
            humans will never make it past this stage. The process of ascending from this stage is so 
            complicated and intricate, that the first half of this manifesto is centered around establishing 
            <i>what</i> the blanket of enlightenment, as depicted in the diagram above, is.</p>
        <p><i><u>Stage III</u></i> of ascension is where most of the members of OCCULT currently reside. This 
            stage comes with great pain, and we must warn you now that a great number of those who choose to 
            pursue enlightenment from Stage II will suffer immensely in the following Stage III. The second half 
            of the manifesto is dedicated to elaborating on this stage of ascension, and how to survive it. This 
            step of the process can end in one of two ways: immense success, or immense failure. There is a very 
            slim window for nothing at all to happen; once one has been awoken by the sun, there is no return to 
            the former state of unawareness.</p>
        <p><i><u>Stages IV and Final</u></i> are not to be elaborated on by OCCULT in this manifesto. They may 
            be touched upon at the very end of the manifesto however, as a guiding stone for those who have been 
            enlightened.

        <p>Q: Can stages be skipped? Reversed? Go out of order?</p>
        <p>OCCULT believes that <i>generally</i> it is the case that for true actualization, most people must 
            undergo all five stages in sequential order. However there are sets of people who might skip some 
            of the stages in a healthy manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Common) Born into 2. Those that fall under this category often will not self-actualize and 
                instead will find some happiness in 2 for the rest of their life, albeit not their maximal 
                potential happiness.</li>
            <li>(Rare) From 1 to 4, with Enlightenment. These are people who are naturally predisposed to have a 
                very strong Will to Power.</li>
            <li>(Rarer) Born into 4. A good portion of some of societies’ greatest people are here—scientists, 
                innovators, mathematicians, writers—all born with a stable sense of self and a lot of drive to 
                produce.</li>
            <li>(Extremely rare) Born into 5. They were raised by individuals who are in 5, or were always smart 
                enough to continuously self-actualize at this stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other than the situations described above, OCCULT believes that skipping stages will generally produce 
            negative effects on one’s personhood, as they are all generally crucial to one’s development.</p>
        <p>Note: At any point in time, it is possible for a person to relate to any of the characteristics in any 
            of the stages and slide back and forth to exercise the modes of each stage. The OCCULTIAN theory is 
            not mathematically axiomatized, but a general theory of personhood. To be considered “in” a stage, 
            one should show most or all of the characteristics from that stage for an extended period of time. 
            It may also be possible to be “in between” two stages at once, but one can never be in two
            non-continuous stages at once (this is called skipping).</p>
        <p>Note: This diagram makes use of terms from Nietzsche and existentialism. We will provide you with a 
            very brief summary of these definitions, however the reader is heavily encouraged to read Nietzsche 
            for themselves.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Master morality</i> is a mindset that values assertiveness, nobility, and power. Traditionally 
                associated with aristocrats, the upper class, the monarchy, etc.</li>
            <li><i>Slave morality</i> is a mindset that defines evil as greed, oppression, and power, and defines 
                good as generosity and kindness. Traditionally associated with the common person, those of lower 
                social status, and Christianity.</li>
            <li><i>The Will to Power</i> is a concept where people escape both master and slave morality to 
                define their own values, and self-actualize.</li>
