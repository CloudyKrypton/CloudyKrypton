        <h1>Hegel - Phenomenology of Spirit</h1>
	
	    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funnily enough, I think that the preface is the longest section of the book that Hegel has written. 
            What's double interesting is that he wrote it after everything else—in this way, we are similar, because I always write the introduction of my essays last. 
            After all, why would you introduce and summarize a piece of your own work that you haven't even written yet?<p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each paragraph took me anywhere from 10-30 minutes to digest the full meaning. This text is full of really important ideas of its time that are still relevant 
            to today, so I'm excited to summarize it here.</p>

        <h3>What Hegel Can and Can’t Do</h3>
        <div class="heading">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Hegel write a preface?</div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="subheading">Part 1: Too much empty talking in a preface</div>
	    <p>An interesting way to open up the preface of your book, positing that writing a preface for philosophy is impossible. Hegel first looks at how philosophy differs from other subjects, such as the natural sciences and history. Other books, Hegel argues, are something that you can read and absorb information from because they’re just a regurgitation of events, whether it be scientific results or historical accounts of things. Philosophy on the other hand, must be actively engaged with because the author has applied themselves to write down their ideas, requiring you to apply yourself too. Bad philosophy is just regurgitated dogmatic statements that require no active application from the reader, and just a blind intake of ideas.</p>
	    <p>Prefaces are therefore inappropriate and misleading because they are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li type="a">Historical: a retelling of how the author wrote the book</li>
            <li type="a">Contingent: the author wrote the book because they had a random idea for it one day—philosophy should be represented as much less random, and much more necessary</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is all to say: is it possible to talk about philosophy at all? Or is the only option, because philosophy requires so much engagement, to do it?</p>
        <div class="subheading">Part 2: Philosophy is a science</div>
        <p>Hegel establishes two important terms: the universal and the particular. There is a back and forth dialogue between universals, which are general entities that are used to explain real life phenomena, and group things together, and particulars, which are individual entities; what we can actually experience. An example is that a red bus is a particular, since it only occupies one spot in the spatio-temporal world at a time, but redness is a universal, since it exists across thousands of buses and individuals at the same time.</p>
        <p>Some people think that philosophy is aimed at universality and looking at questions like: what are the universals? How are they concerned and connect with each other? But Hegel sees philosophy as one of the sciences (more on this later, hold onto this idea). If a preface should be truly philosophical, and philosophy is a matter of science, then it’s insufficient to say, “here’s what I’m looking for and here’s what I found”. If you want to fully learn a science like anatomy, it’s not enough to learn about just the universals, you need to delve into the particulars as well (i.e. by dissecting a couple of bodies). By oversimplifying in a preface, we lose sense of what philosophy is trying to do; philosophers are trying to teach and convey their ideas, and unlike anatomists, they don’t have labs, the learning of particulars must take place inside of the head.</p>
        <div class="subheading"> Conclusion: Hegel cannot write the preface </div>
        <p>—in a standard way. Instead of summarizing, he will fully explore and introduce the phenomenology of the Spirit in the way that he discussed before, through active engagement and direct application of ideas.</p>

        <div class="heading">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship of Hegel’s philosophy to other works in the past and present</div>
	    <p>Something else that prefaces typically do is connect their work to work done by other people who have contributed to the same field. Hegel however, feels that it is ill-fitting to do this in his preface, as it is an extraneous and less relevant concern. He does not want to clarify how his critique is more advanced than his predecessors. A mistake that students of philosophy tend to make is to think of an idea as either true or false, to pick what they deem the correct, most advanced theory out of a bunch and discard the other. A misguided idea: something is either the truth and therefore accepted, or contradicted by the truth, and therefore rejected. Philosophy in this way has the tendency to narrow its viewpoint too much. What’s better is to look at the diversity of philosophical systems as the gradual unfolding of the truth.</p>
	    <p>Hegel compares ideas to plants: beginning with a bud, which is replaced by a flower, which is replaced by a fruit. Each stage is more advanced than the previous, and works towards the end product, yet we cannot say that one is “correct” and another isn’t; all are equally important in the progression of truth.</p>
	    <p>Therefore, Hegel does touch upon (and takes down) some previous ideas that he thinks are incorrect in the preface, but he makes note that we should not dismiss them as incorrect, and instead see them as the unfolding of the True.</p>

        <h3>How Hegel Wants You to Think About Philosophy</h3>
        <div class="heading">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the inner meaning of a philosophical work?</div>
	    <p>A lot of people talk about their aims and results in a preface, but this again, is not complete, and not the real issue that we should be interested in. Philosophy cannot be exhausted simply by talking about goals and results, because merely saying that you are going to do something/here’s the result of what has been done is not engaging in it (as he established in p.1, this is essential). In philosophy, the result contains the process; the journey is a part of the product.</p>
	    <p>In a preface, a relevant history of philosophy is included, but a good history of philosophy will also contain the mind of the philosopher. If you want to fully understand a philosophy, you must take the time to fully digest and understand its philosopher, and the work must represent their mind. To judge something is easy, and to comprend it is harder, and to blend judgement and comprehension is the hardest thing of all.</p>

        <div class="heading">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do people become cultured?</div>
	    <p>In many societies, people are caught up in substantial life—hazy, unthinking, automatic processes. As an example, buying a textbook for a course is a part of a substantial student life. But this substantial life can be interrupted when people ask you, why are you buying this? Why not just pirate it, or find a used copy? Substantial life is disrupted when you start to question why you do things. Hegel introduces the idea of immediacy, which is an idea that comes back throughout the rest of the preface. There is nothing mediating substantial life, no external logical operator; it is mediating itself. Culture is something that is external to substantial life; it is an emergence, through acquiring general principles that allow you to arrive at a mediated way of seeing things. To become cultured is to be able to pull yourself out of society, and the way that people think about things, and to be able to apply reasons to why you do what you do. It is to pronounce reasoned judgement and classify your thoughts, to be able to pass it on to others. Real thought requires struggle.</p>

        <div class="heading">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true shape of truth: scientific system of truth</div>
	    <p>If not immediate thought, then what should philosophy be? Hagel sees philosophy as something that needs to be treated like a science; to take thought and put it into one big system. To be scientific, there should be a systematic process that allows philosophy to actually generate usable, working knowledge. Philosophy up until now (Hegel’s time) has not been a science—it has just been a system of errors and hypotheses, but the time is now for a system of truth—and this is the crux of Phenomenology of Spirit, because Hegel will do this.</p>

        <h3>Science VS Intuition</h3>
        <div class="heading">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegel dislikes oversimplification.</div>
	    <p>A common viewpoint that philosophers have is that truth is only knowable in your intuition—in your direct, unmediated grasp (Spinoza had this view). For Spinoza, truth is comprehended in the essence of things, which is intuitive. For example, we can’t know a lot of things, but we can intuitively know that the sunrise is beautiful. This is not rational, but it is the only form of knowable truth.</p>
	    <p>Hegel believes that this is incorrect and lazy. We need discursive knowledge, and a proper scientific process, because experience, just that one moment, is not something sustainable that you can carry around with you. Intuition is cheap and easy, and what’s harder and what’s actually important is progressively synthesizing knowledge.</p>

        <div class="heading">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of p.6; Hegel dislikes oversimplification.</div>
        <p>This book is called the Phenomenology of the Spirit, and what is the Spirit that Hegel is discussing here? My interpretation is that he’s talking about the human spirit, humanity as a collective, and the body of human knowledge and ideas.</p>
        <p>In the past, Spirit was only a substantial life. There was an immediacy of faith, and people held satisfaction and security about their certainty. There was a reconciliation with an essential being ([a] god) and its presence.</p>
	    <p>Hegel thinks that this is all a pipe dream, and now all of those things have been corroded. What was going on in Europe during Hegel’s time? Enlightenment. Spirit has been stripped of its certainty and substantial life by enlightenment, as humans realize how faulty their judgement is: human consciousness is now an “insubstantial reflection of itself into itself”. Thinking and generation ideas; there is a movement of humanity that is folding back in upon itself and reflecting. This was during the time of major revolutions in Europe.</p>
	    <p>What do we then demand from philosophy? There is a hole in Spirit that has been caused by the loss of substantial life, and philosophy must recover this loss through establishing a generative system of knowledge. There is a new demand. We can no longer simply “feel” for the Absolute, like Spinoza wanted us to, we must work for a system.</p>
