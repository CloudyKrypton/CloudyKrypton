        <h1>Why am I not responding to your messages?</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately we're now kind of at this point where I feel like
            I need to make this page. This isn't to
            shirk accountability, I promise you that I have been thinking about this
            problem for a while now, and at the very least, right now, I am accutely 
            aware of the negative impact of my unresponsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>Texting is difficult for me, and the reasons behind this are complex, and for
            me alone to handle. My hopes with this page though is to create a temporary 
            bandaid for this problem while I sort it out.
        </p>
        <p>Reasons why I might be ghosting you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm not yet comfortable with you. (90% likelihood)
                <br>I don't feel like I can 
                quite be myself around you, or 
                I feel like I need to put in a lot of effort to talk
                to you.
                This is the most likely reason.
                
                It's never personal; 
                this is the reason I ghost my own mom who I love. Sucks for me cuz
                it's a lil difficult to make new friends like this.
            </li>
            <li>I genuinely missed the message/haven't seen it yet. (8% likelihood
                if it's been more than 5 hrs)
            </li>
            <li>I'm annoyed by you/don't like you. (2% likelihood)
                <br>This is very rare and you are generally safe to assume this isn't true.
                However if you have doubts, here's a really easy way to tell: if I've responded
                at all, no matter how long it took, that means it's not this.
                <br>I take a long time to respond to messages, but I will always eventually
                respond.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process goes something like this: Open chat, read message, react internally,
            close chat, repeat the following steps until I respond:
            feel stressed, ruminate and vaguely draft potential responses,
            forget, randomly remember.</p>
        <p>So I guess if it gives you any solace I'm also really stressed through
            this whole processes.
        </p>
        <p>Man.</p>
